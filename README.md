# JuicePlantStats-Project

uicePlantStats Project

This repository contains a project for simulating and analyzing operational data for a juice plant. The primary objective is to generate and visualize random data variations in production metrics over time to monitor and assess performance.

Features:
Data Simulation: Generates random data with high variation for production metrics including material input/output, temperature, and juice production.
Database Schema: Designed with tables to store and manage simulated data, including columns for load usage, material loss, and different types of juice.
Dynamic Data Generation: Uses SQL scripts to insert simulated data into the database, with variations in values to create realistic and diverse datasets.
Visualization: Intended for use with data visualization tools like Power BI to create interactive and insightful dashboards.
Key Components:
SQL Scripts: Contains scripts to create and populate the database with simulated data.
Data Columns: Includes fields such as Timestamp, LoadUsage, Temperature, MaterialIn, MaterialOut, MaterialLost, RedJuice, GreenJuice, BlueJuice, and DamagedBottles.
Visualization: Guidance on how to connect the data to Power BI for creating real-time, interactive dashboards.
Usage:
Database Setup: Use the provided SQL scripts to set up the database schema and insert simulated data.
Data Analysis: Connect the database to Power BI or similar tools to visualize the data and create dashboards.
Project Customization: Modify the data generation scripts to adjust the range and frequency of data variations as needed.
